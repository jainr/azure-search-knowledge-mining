# Custom Skill Built using Python and Flask 

The purpose of this skill is to show how you can leverage Python code as part of the Cognitive Search ingestion in the form of a custom skill.  Since this is hosted in a Docker container, the service can be easily scaled using Kubernetes.  This readme will walk through how to setup and configure the docker instance to run this skill and then how to hook it up as a Custom Skill.
